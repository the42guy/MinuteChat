You can rest assured about Minute Chat's performance and its stability.\r\n\r\n### Works over the LAN \r\nWell, where else? A school project needs to run on the LAN. It uses a basic server-client topology, with the program files stored at a network location that can be accessed by all the users of the chat program. \r\n\r\n### Fast\r\nQuick and light on resources. That's to be expected from a ~10kB program. Means about any computer from this century can run Minute Chat. Reading the chat files over the LAN is also not a problem, as typical chat files can be read within seconds.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by @the42guy and Mayank Jain.\r\n",
